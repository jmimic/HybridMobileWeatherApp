# HybridMobileWeatherApp
Built with Ionic and Cordova with Angular4 and Node.js
<br>
!! Fixes required:
!! Build app with ionic production release build (makes app load significantly faster)
!! Drawback: As of yet not interested as it is a small weather app and working on learning more technologies
!! Time consuming to generate key, sign app, and zip apk
