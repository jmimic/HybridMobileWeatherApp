# HybridMobileWeatherApp
Built with Ionic and Cordova with Angular4 and Node.js<br>
<br>
!! Fixes required: <br>
!! Build app with ionic production release build (makes app load significantly faster)<br>
!! Drawback: As of yet not interested as it is a small weather app and working on learning more technologies<br>
!! Time consuming to generate key, sign app, and zip apk<br>
